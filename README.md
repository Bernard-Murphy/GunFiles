# 3dGunFiles

3dGunFiles is an old site that I made that I planned to host on either 3dgunfiles.net or gunfiles.net, both of which are domains that I own. It is one of the first sites that I built using Node. The site would have contained information for people looking for information on the 3d printing of firearms materials. I chose not to release it for ethical concerns.
